# SpatialMTAI
Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits profound metabolic plasticity, contributing to immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. While spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics technologies have revolutionized our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment (TME), integrating these datasets remains a significant challenge due to differences in spatial resolution and data structure. This limitation hinders the mapping of transcript-driven metabolic reprogramming, making it difficult to identify metabolic targets for improving immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) efficacy.
To bridge this gap, we developed SpatialMTAI (Spatial Metabolomics and Transcriptomics Alignment and Integration), a bioinformatics tool for integrating spatial transcriptomics and metabolomics data in CRC. Our tool aligns spatial metabolite-transcript (MT) data and annotates metabolite profiles using KEGG and HMDB databases, facilitating the joint analysis of MT correlations and heterogeneity.
